## üéØ Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques on Spotify audio data to address two distinct problems:

1. **Music Genre Classification**: Automatically classify songs into 10 different genres based on audio features
2. **Song Popularity Prediction**: Predict the popularity score of tracks using audio characteristics

The project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for both classification and regression tasks, with comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, and model validation.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: 
  - Distribution analysis of audio features and popularity
  - Correlation analysis between different audio characteristics
  - Visualization of relationships between features and popularity

- **Dual ML Approach**:
  - Genre classification with 46% accuracy across 10 genres
  - Popularity prediction with R¬≤ score of 0.15

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal k values
  - Distance metric comparison (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev)
  - Cross-validation for robust performance evaluation

- **Rich Visualizations**:
  - Feature distributions and correlations
  - Confusion matrices and classification reports
  - Prediction vs. actual value plots
  - Residual analysis for regression model

## üìä Dataset

The dataset contains Spotify audio features for thousands of songs, including:

### Audio Features
- **Danceability**: How suitable a track is for dancing (0.0-1.0)
- **Energy**: Perceptual measure of intensity (0.0-1.0)
- **Loudness**: Overall volume in decibels (dB)
- **Speechiness**: Presence of spoken words (0.0-1.0)
- **Acousticness**: Measure of acoustic quality (0.0-1.0)
- **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals (0.0-1.0)
- **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience (0.0-1.0)
- **Valence**: Musical positivity conveyed by the track (0.0-1.0)
- **Tempo**: Estimated tempo in beats per minute (BPM)
- **Duration**: Track duration in milliseconds

### Target Variables
- **Track Genre**: Musical genre category (10 most frequent genres)
- **Popularity**: Popularity score assigned by Spotify (0-100)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Data Exploration and Visualization
```bash
python data_exploration.py
```
This script will:
- Load and explore the Spotify dataset
- Generate visualizations of audio features
- Create correlation matrices
- Analyze popularity distributions

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
```bash
python model_training.py
```
This script will:
- Preprocess the data (normalization, encoding)
- Train KNN models for both classification and regression
- Optimize hyperparameters
- Generate performance metrics and visualizations

### 3. Generated Outputs
The scripts will create several visualization files:
- `popularity_distribution.png`
- `audio_features_distribution.png`
- `correlation_matrix.png`
- `confusion_matrix.png`
- `knn_cv_scores.png`
- `regression_predictions.png`
- `residuals_analysis.png`

## üìà Results

### Genre Classification Model
- **Overall Accuracy**: 46.05% (significantly better than random 10%)
- **Best Performing Genres**:
  - Ambient: F1-score 0.75
  - Black-metal: F1-score 0.76
- **Optimal Configuration**:
  - k = 59 neighbors
  - Manhattan distance metric
  - Cross-validation score: 0.4636

### Popularity Prediction Model
- **R¬≤ Score**: 0.1508 (explains ~15% of variance)
- **RMSE**: 20.39
- **Optimal Configuration**:
  - k = 11 neighbors
  - Euclidean distance metric
  - MSE: 415.85

### Key Insights
- Genres with distinctive audio signatures (ambient, black-metal) are more easily classified
- Audio features alone have limited predictive power for popularity
- Danceability shows positive correlation with popularity
- Acousticness negatively correlates with popularity

## üî¨ Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Missing Value Handling**: Checked and handled missing values
2. **Feature Selection**: Used 13 numerical audio features
3. **Genre Filtering**: Limited to 10 most frequent genres for balanced classification
4. **Normalization**: Applied StandardScaler to all numerical features
5. **Encoding**: Used LabelEncoder for genre categories

### Model Development
1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Systematic search for optimal k values
2. **Distance Metric Comparison**: Evaluated Euclidean, Manhattan, and Chebyshev distances
3. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust performance estimation
4. **Model Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics

## üéØ Future Improvements

- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features like lyrics sentiment or artist popularity
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Explore Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models for better performance
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Implement multi-level genre classification
- **External Factors**: Include marketing data, release timing, and social media metrics
